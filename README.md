The 3D model was designed to be produced on a 3D printer. It is easy to print and doesn't require any supports.

⚠️ **In case of any questions** – do not hesitate to contact the author in Telegram group ([see below](#contact-me)) and ask.

## HOWTO

There are the following options to get a colored model:
  * Use a multi-color 3D printer;
  * Print the model and color it manually;
  * Use the Prusa's [Color change](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/color-change_1687) functionality and print. If you have any other slicers, just google, they all probably have a similar option.
