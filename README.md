The 3D model was designed to be produced on a 3D printer. It is easy to print and doesn't require any supports.

‚ö†Ô∏è **In case of any questions** ‚Äì do not hesitate to contact the author in Telegram group ([see below](#contact-me)) and ask.

## HOWTO
‚ö†Ô∏è Before assembling read the topic to the bottom!

This 3D model is highly customizable. So you can configure it for you needs.

If you do not need any customizations and would only like to have the same **Snowman Christmas tree decoration**  as I have ‚Äì you can download prerendered STL files: 
 * https://t.me/YarickWorkshop/579 - with chamfers;
 * https://t.me/YarickWorkshop/580 - angular version.

There are the following options to get a colored model:
  * Use a multi-color 3D printer;
  * Print the model and color it manually;
  * Use the Prusa's [Color change](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/color-change_1687) functionality and print. If you have any other slicers, just google, they all probably have a similar option.
